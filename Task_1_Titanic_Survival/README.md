#Titanic Survival Prediction

This project was completed as part of the CodSoft Data Science Virtual Internship.  
The goal of this task is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using basic machine learning techniques.

## About the Project
The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset used for beginner-level machine learning projects.  
In this task, I used passenger information such as age, gender, class, fare, and embarkation point to build a model that predicts survival.

The focus of this project was not just accuracy, but understanding the complete data science workflow.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following key features:
- Survived (target variable)
- Passenger Class (Pclass)
- Sex
- Age
- Fare
- Embarked

The dataset is provided in CSV format and is included in this folder.

## What I Did
The project was completed using the following steps:
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Selected relevant features for prediction
- Handled missing values in the data
- Converted categorical data into numerical form
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Trained a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification metrics

---

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## Results
- Model: Logistic Regression  
- Accuracy: Approximately 79%

The model performed well on unseen data and provided a solid baseline for predicting passenger survival.

## Conclusion
This project helped me understand how raw data is cleaned, processed, and used to train a machine learning model.  
It also strengthened my understanding of model evaluation and interpretation.

Overall, this task gave me practical experience with an end-to-end machine learning project.
