Iris Flower Classification

This project was completed as part of the CodSoft Data Science Virtual Internship.
The goal of this task is to classify Iris flower species using machine learning techniques based on their physical measurements.

About the Project

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset widely used for understanding classification problems in machine learning.
In this task, I used flower measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width to build a model that predicts the species of the flower.

The focus of this project was to understand multi-class classification and the complete machine learning workflow.

Dataset

The dataset includes the following key features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

Species (target variable)

The dataset is provided in CSV format and is included in this folder.

What I Did

The project was completed using the following steps:

Loaded and explored the dataset

Visualized data to understand class distribution and feature relationships

Separated input features and target variable

Encoded categorical labels into numerical form

Split the dataset into training and testing sets

Trained a Logistic Regression model

Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification metrics

Tools Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Results

Model: Logistic Regression

Accuracy: 100%

The high accuracy achieved is expected due to the clean and well-separated nature of the Iris dataset.

Conclusion

This project helped me understand multi-class classification, model training, and evaluation techniques.
It also strengthened my understanding of how feature patterns influence model predictions.

Overall, this task provided practical experience with classification algorithms and performance evaluation.
