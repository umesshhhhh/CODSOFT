Iris Flower Classification

This project was completed as part of the CodSoft Data Science Virtual Internship.
The goal of this task is to classify Iris flower species using basic machine learning techniques.

About the Project

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset used for beginner-level machine learning projects.
In this task, I used flower measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width to build a model that predicts the species of a flower.

The focus of this project was not just accuracy, but understanding the complete data science workflow for multi-class classification.

Dataset

The dataset includes the following key features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

Species (target variable)

The dataset is provided in CSV format and is included in this folder.

What I Did

The project was completed using the following steps:

Loaded and explored the dataset

Visualized feature relationships to understand class separation

Separated input features and target variable

Encoded categorical labels into numerical form

Split the dataset into training and testing sets

Trained a Logistic Regression model

Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification metrics

Tools Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Results

Model: Logistic Regression

Accuracy: 100%

The model achieved high accuracy due to the clean and well-separated nature of the Iris dataset.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete multi-class classification workflow, from data visualization and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

It highlights how structured numerical features can be used to build accurate and interpretable machine learning models.
