📌 Problem Statement

Using the Iris dataset, predict the species of a flower by analyzing features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains measurements of Iris flowers, including:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

Species (target variable)

The dataset is provided in CSV format and is included in this repository.

⚙️ Approach

The following steps were followed in this project:

Loaded and explored the dataset

Visualized feature relationships to understand class separation

Separated input features and target variable

Encoded categorical species labels into numerical form

Split the data into training and testing sets

Trained a Logistic Regression classification model

Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification metrics

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

📊 Results

Model Used: Logistic Regression

Accuracy Achieved: 100%

The high accuracy is expected due to the clean and well-separated nature of the Iris dataset.

✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete multi-class classification workflow, from data visualization and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
It highlights how machine learning algorithms can accurately classify structured data when clear feature patterns exist.
